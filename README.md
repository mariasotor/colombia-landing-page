# About this project
I developed this project as part of the SheCodes Responsive workshop to practice my HTML, vanilla CSS, and responsive design skills.

# My inspiration
After Living abroad for several years, I became aware of the numerous misconceptions surrounding Colombia (my home country). Motivated by this, I decided to develop this project to highlight the many wonders that Colombia has to offer.
